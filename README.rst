wpm â€” console app that measures your typing speed
=================================================
|versions| |license| |pypi|

WPM is a terminal program that measures your typing speed in words per minute
(WPM).

The WPM is calculated using the usual formula CPS/5, where CPS is characters
per second, or the number of correct characters you've typed so far, divided by
elapsed time.

Compared to sites like typeracer.com, this WPM is a little bit higher, but is a
very common way to gauge your typing speed.

How to install
==============

::

    $ pip install wpm

How to run
==========

Just type

.. code:: bash

    $ wpm

You can also train a single custom text. In that case, just do

.. code:: bash

    $ wpm --load yourfile.txt

If you want to bundle up several texts into one file, just create a JSON file
with the following format

.. code:: json

    [
      {
        "author": "Author Name",
        "title": "Title of Work",
        "text": "The text to type here ..."
      },

      {
        "author": "Author Name",
        "title": "Title of Work",
        "text": "The text to type here ..."
      },

      ...
    ]

You load JSON files by doing

.. code:: bash

    $ wpm --load-json yourfile.json
